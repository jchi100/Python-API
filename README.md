# Python-API

Background
This project is to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?" 

WeatherPy
By creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. A simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API is used to get latitude and longitude of world cities.

A series of scatter plots generated to showcase the following relationships:
•	Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
•	Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
•	Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
•	Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Steps:
•	at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
•	Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
•	Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number, city name, and requested URL.
•	A CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot are saved.

WeatherPyReport.docx describes of three observable trends based on the charts.

Tools:  Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
