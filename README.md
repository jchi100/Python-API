# Python-API

This project is to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?" 

WeatherPy

By creating a project with Python to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. A simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API is used to get latitude and longitude of world cities.

A series of scatter plots generated to showcase the following relationships:
•	Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
•	Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
•	Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
•	Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Steps:
•	Generate a dataset of latitude and longitude of at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities.
•	Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
•	Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number, city name, and requested URL.
•	A CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot are saved.

Tools:  Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
